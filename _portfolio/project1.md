This study examined the concentrations and compositions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminants in the sediments of the Saint John Harbour (SJH) and assessed PAH exposure to local aquatic biota through analyses of nekton community diversity, PAH tissue levels, hepatic EROD activity, and condition factor in Atlantic silversides. The findings suggest that PAH contamination is heterogeneous and widespread in the SJH, with several sites exceeding the recommended guidelines for the protection of aquatic life. Despite high total PAH concentrations at some sites, there was no indication that local aquatic life was affected. Lack of a biological response may be due in part to a low bioavailability of sediment PAHs, presence of confounding factors (e.g., trace metals), and/or adaptation of local wildlife to the historic PAH pollution in this region. Overall, although no indication of effects to wildlife was observed with the data collected in the present study, continued efforts should be made to remediate and reduce the prevalence of these compounds in this area.
