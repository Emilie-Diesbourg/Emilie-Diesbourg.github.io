This study focuses on the influence of municipal wastewater treatement plant effluent exposure on the microbial composition and diversity and nutrient excretion of downstream benthic and emergent aquatic insects from the Bow River, Calgary, AB. Stable isotopes are used to determine food web structure and whether there is trophic transfer of contaminants to riparian spiders.
