Determining the spatial scale at which genetic structuring occurs is one of the main goals of
conservation genetics because such data can help identify management units. This study assessed
the hierarchical genetic structure of Atlantic salmon young-of-the-year in the Upper Salmon
River, NB at a fine spatial scale (~6 km). Using seven microsatellite loci, genetic clustering
analyses and FST estimates were computed to determine the strength of genetic structure within
the river. Patterns of genetic structure were then tested to detect whether they aligned with
previously identified morphological groupings, using the same individuals. Subtle genetic
differentiation (mean pairwise FST=0.036) and a weak isolation by distance pattern was found to
exist within this ~6 km stretch of river. Additionally, not all morphological groupings were
genetically distinct. This study highlights the importance of considering within-river genetic
structure across small spatial scales for more informed conservation design.
